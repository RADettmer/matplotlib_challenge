<p>This project works with Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze data drug testing data.
In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
(This is simulated data and was not included in this repository as it was 46KB.)

### Observations and Insights

1) There were ten drug regimens used to treat SCC tumor growth over 45 days. of these, Capomulin seemed to be the most responsive to reduce the tumor volume with Ramicane coming in second.
2) Of the animal study, the sex of the mice were closely split 50.6% male and 49.4% female. 
3) Reviewing the scatter diagram and regression line, Capolmulin again showed a strong correlation with an r-squared value of 0.841. 
4) Suprisingly, in reviewing the box plots, I could not find any outliers in this data set. I even ran one drug by itself to verify. I left this in the code.
